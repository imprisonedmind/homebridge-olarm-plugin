## Description

This plugin utilises WebSockets and [MQTT](https://github.com/mqttjs) to speak
directly to an [Olarm](https://olarm.co) Communicator.
It's intent is to be used to control your alarm system via creating HomeKit and Google
Home Interfaces with
[homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge).

I would like to thank [Louw Hopley](https://github.com/LouwHopley), as his
[repo](https://github.com/LouwHopley/homebridge-olarm-plugin)
gave me a significant starting point.
